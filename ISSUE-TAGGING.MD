# When making an issue, please make sure you're using the right tag!

### For bugs

In the bug category, there is a **bug** tag, and a **critical-bug** tag.

- **Bug should** be used for cases where the program has a minor issue, i.e. something isn't working right (e.g. The issue where attachments only load the lowest-level attachment and remove all others)
- **Critical Bug** should be ***only*** used if there's an issue that causes a *complete conversion failure* that has no notice that says the error was handled (If it treats it like the model converted correctly but exports a very broken and malformed model, for instance). This can also be used if the action you did causes the program to crash.

If you use either of these categories, **please provide a way to recreate the issue.**

### For general feedback.

- **Feature Request** is used for when you have an idea regarding any aspect of the program. New features, changes to existing features, removal of some features, you suggest it.
- **Question** is used for when you don't understand how to use something, or just have any question about usage in general. You can also ask about how some of the stuff works inside (e.g. format). Any question pertaining to this application is OK.

### Do not use

- The Deprecated, Duplicate, In-Progress, and Invalid tags are for usage internally. Please do not assign these tags to your own post.
