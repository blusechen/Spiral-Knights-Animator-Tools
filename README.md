# About the project
This is a revamp of the old, crappy tool dubbed [Spiral Knights Model Converter](https://github.com/XanTheDragon/Spiral-Knights-Model-Converter).

# When can I try it?
There may be a release up in the releases tab. At times I'll remove them.

# When is it truly out and ready for full usage?
~~My rough guess is August 13 at a maximum (Two weeks from now, July 30). I'm actively working.~~

Sorry guys, Deadline Machine ðŸ…±roke, and school starts tomorrow for me. (Upd. August 13)

**Update:** I'm going to try to get back into this. I know it's rather late after the deadline and I've gone silent again. For details, I'm doing a complete rewrite of the reader to make it more modular and behave much better.

# What makes this version better?

* 100% handwritten code - No more using other libraries.
 * Considerably smaller jar size
* Direct binary file reading
 * Considerably faster conversion
 * Guaranteed support for any **model** file (Things like scripts will not convert since they aren't 3D models.)
* **Commnand line support**
* The GUI still works, and has been redone to be much smaller and straightforward.
