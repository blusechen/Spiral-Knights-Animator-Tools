# About the project
This is a revamp of the old, crappy tool dubbed [Spiral Knights Model Converter](https://github.com/XanTheDragon/Spiral-Knights-Model-Converter).

# When is it out?
My rough guess is August 13 at a maximum (Two weeks from now, July 30). I'm actively working.

This version features:

* 100% handwritten code - No more using other libraries.
 * Considerably smaller jar size
* Direct binary file reading
 * Considerably faster conversion
* **Commnand line support**
* The GUI still works, and has been redone to be much smaller and straightforward.
