# About the project
This is a revamp of the old, crappy tool dubbed [Spiral Knights Model Converter](https://github.com/XanTheDragon/Spiral-Knights-Model-Converter).

# What makes this version better, and what does it do? 

This program is simple: It grabs geometry data from Spiral Knights models and exports it into the DAE format.

* 100% handwritten code - No more using other libraries (as in copy/paste of source code. I'm now using JARs)
 * Considerably smaller jar size
* Direct binary file reading
 * Considerably faster conversion
 * Guaranteed support for any **model** file (Things like scripts will not convert since they aren't 3D models.)
* **Commnand line support** (Coming Soon)
* The GUI still works, and has been redone to be much smaller and straightforward.
