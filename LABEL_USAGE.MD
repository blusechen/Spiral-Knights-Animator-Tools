# WHEN USING LABELS

You **may** apply the following labels to your post:

- **Bug** should be used if there's a minor issue with the program like a typo or a display issue in the data tree. This is also what you should use if there's a conversion failure that the program tells you about via an error message.
- **Critical-bug** should *only* be used if there is a major issue that causes a complete conversion failure (e.g. program says it converted, output file is not properly formed or is corrupted) or a program crash entirely. If the error *is* handled (meaning there was some text that came up that says that the model conversion failed), then use the **bug** tag instead.
- **Feature request** should be used if you have any suggestion for any part of the application at all. Even if small. I don't mind.
- **Question** should be used if you have a question involving anything related to the program or the files it converts. Do not use this to ask questions like "When is version xyz coming out?"

You **may not** apply the following labels to your post:

- Invalid
- Duplicate
- Old-version
- In-progress
